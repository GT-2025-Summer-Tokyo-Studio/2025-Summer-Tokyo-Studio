# ArcGIS Interactive Platform

- **Dashboards** [link](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/d30d95c5c09d414fbbe9ca41170330ec)
- **Experience Builder** [link](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/dba9870d0c0f4f36a501eca5dc9c27d5)

The final interface of the platform will be built with ArcGIS Experience Builder as the framework, covering the following core functions:
- Scenario layer switching (e.g. “Status - Planning - Emergency Response”).
- Scenario sliders and drop-down menus (e.g. “Heat Wave Day 2040”, “Redevelopment Scenario B”).
- Dynamic panel of indicators (real-time display of average temperature, FAR utilization, walkability score, etc.).
- Embedded user feedback mechanisms and scenario labeling features to facilitate the collection of user input.
- The design of the navigation page and operation guidance components reduces the threshold of use and supports both on-site display and remote use scenarios.
