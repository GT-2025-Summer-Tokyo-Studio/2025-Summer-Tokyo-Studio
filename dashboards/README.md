# ArcGIS Interactive Platform



The final interface of the platform will be built with ArcGIS Experience Builder as the framework, covering the following core functions:
·   	Scenario layer switching (e.g. “Status - Planning - Emergency Response”).
·   	Scenario sliders and drop-down menus (e.g. “Heat Wave Day 2040”, “Redevelopment Scenario B”).
·   	Dynamic panel of indicators (real-time display of average temperature, FAR utilization, walkability score, etc.).
·   	Embedded user feedback mechanisms and scenario labeling features to facilitate the collection of user input.
·   	The design of the navigation page and operation guidance components reduces the threshold of use and supports both on-site display and remote use scenarios.
